# Cascading style sheets

- Use SASS preprocessor
- For ASP.NET Core use library https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.SassCompiler#readme-body-tab
- separate files for components
- good folder structure to reflect your projects structure
- Favor isolated CSS 
- Put variables at the beginning of a file
- Comment sections and rules, so you don't forget the reason why you have written them
